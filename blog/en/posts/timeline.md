# How to Draw Timeline Diagrams in Mermaid

<span class="post-meta">2026-03-05 · MermZen Tutorial

Timeline diagrams visualize project progress, historical events, product development plans, and time-related information. They are ideal for project management, historical research, and product planning. Mermaid uses `timeline` keyword for timeline diagrams.

## Declaring a Chart

Use `timeline` keyword:

```
timeline
    title Chart Title
```

## Phase Division

Divide timeline into phases, each containing multiple events:

```
timeline
    title Product Development Timeline
    2024-01 : Project Initiation
      - Requirements Analysis
      - Technology Selection
    2024-02 : Architecture Design
      - System Architecture
      - Database Design
    2024-03 : Frontend Development
      - Page Layout
      - Interactive Implementation
    2024-04 : Backend Development
      - API Development
      - Database Development
```

## Detailed Event Description

Add detailed event descriptions for each phase:

```

## Why Use Timeline Diagrams?

Timeline diagrams are linear narrative tools for visualizing the chronological order and development of events.

### What Problems Do They Solve?

- **Visualize chronological order**: Clearly show the sequence of events at a glance
- **Track milestones**: Mark key nodes for easy review and summary
- **Narrative expression**: More storytelling than tables, ideal for presentations
- **Simplify complex timelines**: Condense lengthy history or project progress into visual charts

### Comparison with Gantt Charts and Flowcharts

| Diagram Type | Core Feature | Use Case |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Timeline** | Linear narrative, emphasizes chronological order | Historical events, project milestones, product evolution |
| **Gantt Chart** | Shows task duration and parallel relationships | Project progress management, resource scheduling |
| **Flowchart** | Shows decision branches and process flow | Business processes, algorithm logic, decision trees |

**Key Difference**: Timeline diagrams do not show task duration, only mark the time points when events occur.

### Suitable Scenarios

✅ **Suitable**:
- Product version release history
- Company development milestones
- Historical/biographical event summaries
- Project key node reviews

❌ **Not Suitable**:
- Need to show task duration → Use Gantt chart
- Need to show parallel tasks and dependencies → Use Gantt chart
- Need to show decision branches → Use flowchart
- Need to show organizational structure → Use org chart

## Best Practices

### Recommended Number of Phases

Keep it between **3-8 phases**:

- **Fewer than 3**: Insufficient information, consider using lists or tables
- **3-5**: Best readability, ideal for presentations
- **6-8**: Suitable for detailed planning, but watch the layout
- **More than 8**: Consider splitting into multiple timelines or using other charts

### Events Per Phase

Recommend **1-5 events per phase**:

```
timeline
    title Recommended Event Count Example
    Q1 : First Quarter
      - Requirements research    ✅ 1-5 events optimal
      - Technology selection
      - Architecture design
    Q2 : Second Quarter
      - Core feature development ✅ Keep it concise
      - Unit testing
```

**Avoid over-segmentation**:
```
timeline
    title ❌ Not Recommended: Too Many Events
    Q1 : First Quarter
      - Requirements research
      - Requirements review
      - Requirements confirmation
      - Technology selection
      - Technology review
      - Technology confirmation
      - Architecture design
      - Architecture review
      - ... (too many details)
```

### Choosing Time Span

Select appropriate time granularity based on content:

| Time Span | Recommended Granularity | Example |
|-----------|------------------------|---------|
| Within 1 year | Month/Week | Quarterly planning, project sprints |
| 1-5 years | Quarter/Month | Product roadmap, annual plan |
| Over 5 years | Year/Decade | Company history, industry development |

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Timeline is Not a Gantt Chart

❌ **Misconception**: Thinking timelines can show task duration

```
timeline
    title ❌ Timeline Cannot Express Duration
    Q1 : Development Phase (3 months)  ← Cannot show "duration"
      - Frontend development
      - Backend development
```

✅ **Correct Approach**: Timelines only mark time points; use Gantt charts for duration

```
gantt
    title ✅ Use Gantt Chart to Show Duration
    dateFormat YYYY-MM
    section Development
    Frontend development     :2024-01, 3M
    Backend development      :2024-01, 3M
```

### Mistake 2: Don't Over-Segment

❌ **Over-segmentation**: Including every small task

```
timeline
    title ❌ Over-segmented
    Week1 : First Week
      - Monday meeting
      - Tuesday documentation
      - Wednesday coding
      - Thursday testing
      - Friday deployment
    Week2 : Second Week
      - Monday meeting
      - ...
```

✅ **Appropriate summarization**: Focus on key milestones

```
timeline
    title ✅ Focus on Key Nodes
    Week1 : First Week
      - Complete requirements review
      - Start development
    Week2 : Second Week
      - Complete core features
      - Pass testing
```

### Mistake 3: Timeline is Not a Flowchart

Timelines emphasize **chronological order**, flowcharts emphasize **logical branches**:

- Need to show "if...then..." decision logic → Use flowchart
- Need to show "first...then..." chronological order → Use timeline

## Quick Reference

| Syntax | Function |
|--------|----------|
| `timeline` | Declare timeline diagram |
| `title Title` | Set chart title |
| `Phase Name : Description` | Define timeline phase |
| `- Event` | Event within phase |
| `%% comment` | Line comment |
