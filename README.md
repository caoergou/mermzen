**MermZen** is a clean, lightweight Mermaid diagram editor. Open it, write syntax, see your diagram — that's the whole experience. No setup, no friction, just the diagram.

The name blends **Mermaid** (the diagram syntax) and **Zen** (simplicity). Design and lightness are the point.

## Preview

The diagrams below were exported directly from MermZen in hand-drawn style. The exported SVG can be pasted straight into any HTML page — or embed a live, interactive diagram via `<iframe>`:

## Why MermZen

Mermaid's official live editor is cluttered and overcomplicated: AI upsells, membership prompts, and redundant panels crowd the screen. The interface keeps growing heavier — you just want to write syntax and see a diagram, but instead you're navigating a product that has lost sight of that.

MermZen fills that gap: a CodeMirror 6 editor with Mermaid-aware syntax highlighting, inline error hints with line numbers, and a full keyboard shortcut system. Diagrams are encoded directly in the URL hash, so sharing requires no backend, no account, and no expiring links — just copy the URL.
